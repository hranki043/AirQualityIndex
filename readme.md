This Web Mapping lab provides students with hands-on experience in creating their very own interactive web maps using goejson files they created from data of their choosing. This includes finding data and joining it with a shapefile that represent the area of interest.  Then using GeoJSON.io, students convert their joined shapefile into GeoJSON format. This enables the creation of a customizable and interactive web map. This process allows students to explore thematic topics and visualize their data in a spatial context all while exploring various mapping functionalities. By guiding students through the conversion and customization of geographic data, the lab fosters a deeper understanding of web mapping principles and equips students with practical skills for spatial data visualization and web mapping applications.
